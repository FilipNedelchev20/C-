Tony is a professional golfer and has decided to change the equipment he plays with. To that end, to him
you need to write a program to calculate the value of the purchases given that his
sponsors bear 7/8 of the cost and the remaining 1/8 must be paid by him.
Our player wants to buy n number of golf clubs and m sets of golf balls, as well as other equipment,
worth 20% of the total price of the sticks and balls purchased. It is known that 1 set of golf balls = 1/6
from the price of a golf club.
Input:
3 lines are read from the console:
• Price of one golf club - real number in the interval [0.00...100000.00]
• Number of golf clubs - an integer in the interval [0...100]
• Number of sets of golf balls - an integer in the interval [0...100]
The final price is formed by the sum of the price of the golf clubs, the price of the sets of balls and the price of the
the rest of the gear.
Output:
2 lines are printed on the console:
• "Tony should pay {1/8 of the total price, rounded to the smallest integer}"
• "Sponsors should pay {7/8 of the total price, rounded up to the larger whole number}"
