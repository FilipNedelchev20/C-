A paint shop sells red, green and yellow paint in different sized buckets. They are shown in the table
the types of buckets, the different paints and what is the selling price of one bucket of the respective paint.
Write a program that calculates the store's revenue from sales given the size of the buckets
and paint color. 35% of the final price will cover production costs.
Input:
The input is read from the console and consists of three lines:
• First row - bucket size - text with options "Large", "Medium" or "Small"
• Second row - paint color - text with options "Red", "Green" or "Yellow"
• Third line – number of buckets sold – an integer in the interval [1... 350]
Output:
On one line of the console, print the final price (from the total price of the buckets, deduct the costs)
"{final price} leva."
Format the result to the second digit after the decimal point.
