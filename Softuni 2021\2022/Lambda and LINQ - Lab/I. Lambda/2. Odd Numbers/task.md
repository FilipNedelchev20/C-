Write a program that reads a sequence of integers on a single line, separated by space. Use inline method that checks
if each of the numbers is odd. Print the result in the following format:
 "{number} is odd ‐ {is odd}"
Hints:
Read a line from the console, split it by a space and parse the elements to integers in a collection.
Make an inline boolean method that checks if the number is odd:
Loop through the elements in the collection and use the method on each number and print it in the given format.
