Read a number n and n lines of products. Print a numbered list of all the products ordered by name.
Solution:
First, we need to read the number n from the console.
Then we need to create our list of strings, because the products are strings.
Then we need to iterate n times and read our current product.
The next step is to add the current product to the list.
After we finish reading the products, we sort our list alphabetically.
 The sort method sorts the list in ascending order.
Finally, we have to print our sorted list. To do that we loop through the list.
 We use i + 1, because we want to start counting from 1, we put the '.', and finally we put the actual
product.
