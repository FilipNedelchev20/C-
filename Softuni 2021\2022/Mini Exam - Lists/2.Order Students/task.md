Write a program that helps the teacher to organise the numbers of students who will make exam in different
groups. For this you need to append several groups of numbers in the list of examined students.
 You will receive the groups in a single line separated by '|'.
 The numbers in the groups are separated by spaces (' ', one or several).
 Order the groups in the final list from the last given group to the first, and their values from left to right.
