You will be given an integer N and integer S. The N integer is the number of elements that have to be pushed into
the stack. The S integer is the number of elements that have to be popped from the stack. Finally you will be given
an integer X, an element that you should look for in the stack. If it’s found, print "found" on the console. If it isn’t,
print the smallest element currently present in the stack. If there are no elements in the sequence, print "nothing
found" on the console.

Input:
 On the first line, separated by a single space, you will be given N, S and X
 On the next line you will be given N number of integers

Output:
 If X is present in the stack, print “found”, otherwise print the smallest element in the stack. If the stack is
empty, print "nothing found"
