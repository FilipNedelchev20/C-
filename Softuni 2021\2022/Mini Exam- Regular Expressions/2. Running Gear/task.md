Write a program that keeps track of bought running gear and the calculates the total cost of all items. You will
receive some lines of input until the line "Run!". If a line is valid it will be in the following format:
"<>{gear name}<>{quantity}‐‐{price}"
The price can be floating point number or whole number. Store the names of the gear and the total price. At the end
print the each bought item on separate line in the format:
"Gear bought:
{1st name}
{2nd name}
..."
And on the last line print the following: "Total cost: {spend money}" formatted to the second decimal point.
