Make a program that first receives N – the number of lines with hidden personal data in strings and then the data
lines. You need to find someone`s name and age in each line. Each name starts after a ‘@’ symbol and has ‘|’ in the
end. Each age starts after a ‘#’ symbol and ends with ‘*’ symbol.
Example: "It`s me @Maria| who is #25* years old."
For each found name and age print a line in the following format:
"{name} is {age} years old."
