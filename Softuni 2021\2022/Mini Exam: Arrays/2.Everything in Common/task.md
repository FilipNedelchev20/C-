You are given two arrays of integers. Compare them and according to the case whether all of their elements are
equal, print a message on the console:
 If they are identical:
"Arrays are identical."
 If not:
"Arrays are not identical."
In case the arrays are identical, print on a new line the sum of all elements in one of the arrays with the message:
"Sum: {sum}"
In the other case, print a message pointing the first index where the arrays become different in the format:
"Found difference at {index} index"
