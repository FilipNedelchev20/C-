Create a class called Car. It has the following properties: a name, model and engine (all strings). Until the "end"
command, you will be receiving data in the following format: "{name}/{model}/{engine}". Create an instance
of the Car class for each line. In the end print information for each car in the following format:
Car ‚Äê {name} {model} with engine {engine}
Order the cars in the output first by name, then by model alphabetically.
