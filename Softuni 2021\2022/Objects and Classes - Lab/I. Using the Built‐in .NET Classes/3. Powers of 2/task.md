You will receive N – a number in the range [0 – 1000]. Calculate the 2 to the power N (2 ^ n) and print the result.

Hints:
Use the class BigInteger from the built‐in .NET library System.Numerics.dll.
1. Import the namespace "System.Numerics":
2. Use the type BigInteger to calculate the result.
3. Loop to N and every time multiply the previous result with 2.
