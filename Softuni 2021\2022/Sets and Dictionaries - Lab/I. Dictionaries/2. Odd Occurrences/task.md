Write a program that extracts all elements from a given sequence of words that are present in it an odd number of
times (case‐insensitive).
 Words are given on a single line, space separated.
 Print the result elements in lowercase, in their order of appearance.

Hints:
Read a line from the console and split it by a space
Use a dictionary (string  int) to count the occurrences of each word
Pass through each of the elements in the array and count each word.
Pass through the dictionary and print words that occur odd times.
