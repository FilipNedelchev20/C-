Write a program, which reads a name of a student and his/her grades and adds them to the student record, then
prints the student's names with their grades and their average grade.

Hints:
 Use a dictionary (string  List<decimal>)
 Check if the name exists before adding the grade. If it doesn’t, add it to the dictionary.
 Pass through all key‐value pairs in the dictionary and print the results. You can use the .Average()
method to quickly calculate the average value from a list.
