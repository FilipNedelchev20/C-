Write a program that reads continents, countries and their cities, puts them in a nested dictionary and prints them.
On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow. Then you will receive n count of lines
that contain information in the following format:
{ continent } { country } { city }

Hints:
 Use a nested dictionary (string  (Dictionary  List<string>))
 Check if the continent exists before adding the country. If it doesn’t, add it to the dictionary.
 Check if the country exists, before adding the city. If it doesn’t, add it to the dictionary.
 Pass through all key‐value pairs in the dictionary and the values’ key‐value pairs and print the results.
