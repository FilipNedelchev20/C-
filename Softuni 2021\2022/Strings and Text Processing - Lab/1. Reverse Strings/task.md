You will be given series of strings until you receive an "end" command. Write a program that reverses strings and
prints each pair on separate line in format "{word} = {reversed word}".
Solution:
Use while loop and read strings until you receive "end".
Reverse the string with for loop. Start from the last index and append each symbol to the new string.
Print the reversed string in the specified format.
