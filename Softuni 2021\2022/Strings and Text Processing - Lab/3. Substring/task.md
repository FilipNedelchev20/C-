On the first line you will receive a string. On the second line you will receive a second string. Write a program that
removes all of the matches of the first string in the second until there is no match. At the end print the remaining
string.
Hints:
 Read the input.
 Find the first index where the key appears.
o Use the built‐in method IndexOf()
 Remove the match.
o Use the built‐in method Remove(index, length)
 Repeat it until the text doesn't contain the key anymore.
