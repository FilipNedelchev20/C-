Write a program that takes a string of banned words and text. All words included in the ban list should be replaced
with asterisks "*", equal to the word's length. The entries in the ban list will be separated by a comma and space ", ".
The ban list should be entered on the first input line and the text on the second input line.
Hints:
 Read the input.
 Replace all ban words in the text with asterisk (*).
o Use the built‐in method Replace(banWord, replacement).
o Use new string(char ch, int repeatCount) to create the replacement
