Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. To do this, you need to define a Rectangle class and create
a Rectangle object. It should have width, height (integers) and color (string). Your task is to calculate its area,
and print.
You are given two numbers on two lines. First number is width and the second number is height. Use the correct
properties from the Rectangle class and print the result in the following format:
"Rect({Width}, {Height}, {Color}) has area {Area}.")

Hints:
Create a file for this class: [Project] ‐> [Add Class] or: right click on the project [Add] ‐> [New Item] ‐>
[Class]
Make the class public and add properties Width, Height (integers) and Color.
Read the input, create a new Rectangle object, and set the read data into it.
Use the given input, calculate the area by getting the data from the object and print the result.

Note:
To test your solution for this task, move your Rectangle class after Program class.
